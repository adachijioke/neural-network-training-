# Neural Network Training Marketplace (neural-network-dmarket)

A decentralized marketplace for AI model training combining Web3 and artificial intelligence. This platform lets data providers stake tokens on their dataset quality while machine learning developers can bid for training computation time.

## Key Features

1. **Dataset Registration and Staking**
   - Data providers can register their datasets with quality stakes
   - Minimum stake requirement ensures dataset quality commitment
   - Stakes are locked until dataset validation

2. **Computation Marketplace**
   - ML developers can place bids for computation time
   - Bid system includes computation duration and deadlines
   - Automatic matching of bids with dataset providers

3. **Model Validation System**
   - Automated validation of model improvements
   - Performance thresholds for reward distribution
   - Quality scoring mechanism for datasets

4. **Reward Distribution**
   - Performance-based reward distribution
   - Automatic payment execution upon validation
   - Stake slashing for poor-quality datasets

## Smart Contracts

### Main Contracts

1. **neural-training-market**
   - Core marketplace functionality
   - Handles dataset registration and staking
   - Manages computation bids
   - Controls validation and reward distribution

## Technical Implementation

### Prerequisites
- Clarity CLI
- Stacks blockchain network access
- STX tokens for testing

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/neural-network-dmarket
cd neural-network-dmarket
```

2. Deploy the contracts:
```bash
clarinet contract deploy neural-training-market
```

### Usage

1. **Register a Dataset**
```clarity
(contract-call? .neural-training-market register-dataset u1000000 "ipfs://dataset-metadata")
```

2. **Place a Computation Bid**
```clarity
(contract-call? .neural-training-market place-computation-bid u1 u500000 u100 u150)
```

3. **Submit Validation Results**
```clarity
(contract-call? .neural-training-market submit-validation-result u1 u1 u85)
```

4. **Claim Rewards**
```clarity
(contract-call? .neural-training-market claim-validation-reward u1)
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Staking Security**
   - Minimum stake requirements
   - Locked stakes during active periods
   - Slashing conditions for malicious behavior

2. **Validation Integrity**
   - Performance threshold requirements
   - Multi-stage validation process
   - Automated result verification

3. **Economic Security**
   - Balanced reward distribution
   - Protection against gaming the system
   - Stake-weighted voting mechanisms

## Future Enhancements

1. Governance mechanism for parameter updates
2. Enhanced validation metrics
3. Integration with decentralized compute networks
4. Cross-chain compatibility
5. Advanced reward distribution algorithms
