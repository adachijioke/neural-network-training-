# Neural Network Training Marketplace (NNTM)

A decentralized marketplace for AI model training combining Web3 and artificial intelligence. This project enables data providers to monetize high-quality datasets while allowing ML developers to access computing resources and training data in a trustless environment.

## Core Features

### 1. Dataset Quality Staking
- Data providers stake tokens to guarantee dataset quality
- Minimum stake requirement of 1000 tokens
- Stake slashing for poor quality data
- Quality scoring based on usage and model performance

### 2. Computation Marketplace
- ML developers place bids for computation time
- Smart matching of compute providers with requirements
- Automated payment distribution
- SLA enforcement through smart contracts

### 3. Model Validation
- Automated performance measurement
- Baseline comparison tracking
- Decentralized validation nodes
- Performance improvement verification

### 4. Reward Distribution
- Performance-based token rewards
- Multi-stakeholder reward splitting
- Automated distribution based on smart contract terms
- Incentive alignment mechanism

## Smart Contracts

### AIDatasetRegistry
Manages dataset registration and quality staking. Data providers can:
- Register new datasets with metadata
- Stake tokens on quality
- Update dataset information
- Withdraw stakes after lock period

### ComputationMarket
Handles the marketplace for compute resources:
- Bid placement and matching
- Compute time allocation
- Payment processing
- SLA enforcement

### ModelValidation
Validates AI model improvements:
- Performance metric tracking
- Automated testing
- Result verification
- Improvement calculation

### RewardDistribution
Manages the reward system:
- Token distribution
- Performance-based calculations
- Claim processing
- Stake rewards

## Setup and Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Compile contracts:
```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

3. Run tests:
```bash
npx hardhat test
```

4. Deploy:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network-name>
```

## Technical Requirements

- Node.js >=14.0.0
- Hardhat
- OpenZeppelin Contracts
- Solidity ^0.8.19

## Security Considerations

- Multi-signature wallet integration for admin functions
- Timelock mechanisms for critical operations
- Emergency pause functionality
- Comprehensive audit requirements
- Stake slashing conditions
- Oracle attack prevention
